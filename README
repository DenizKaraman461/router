## ROUTER: Network Security & Traffic Analysis Suite

NetToolkit is a Python-based network security project I built to better understand how local networks work and how common attack techniques operate in practice.
The goal of this toolkit is educational: to explore concepts like ARP spoofing, Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, packet sniffing, and traffic analysis in a controlled lab environment.
This project focuses on learning by building — not just using tools, but understanding what happens behind the scenes.

## 🚀 Features
🔎 Network Scanner

Discovers active devices on the local network using ARP requests.
It helps identify hosts, IP addresses, and MAC addresses within the subnet.

## 🔁 ARP Poisoning (MITM)

Implements ARP spoofing to redirect traffic between a target device and the gateway.
This demonstrates how Man-in-the-Middle attacks manipulate ARP tables.

## 🌐 DNS Monitor

Monitors DNS queries in real time to observe which domains a target machine is requesting.

## 🔐 Credential Auditing

Captures unencrypted HTTP traffic to detect potential login data and visited URLs.
(This only works on HTTP — not HTTPS — which highlights why encryption matters.)

## 🧭 IP Forwarding Automation

Includes automated PowerShell integration to enable IP forwarding on Windows systems for proper traffic routing during MITM testing.

## 🛠️ Project Structure
File	Tool Name	Description
main.py	NetToolkit	Main CLI interface to run scanning, spoofing, and sniffing together
lanlord.py	LAN Lord	ARP spoofer with integrated DNS monitoring
dns.py	DNS Monitor	Standalone DNS query monitoring tool
scanner.py	Net Scanner	Simple ARP-based network discovery script
sniffer.py	HTTP Sniffer	Packet sniffer focused on HTTP traffic and POST data

## 📋 Prerequisites

Python 3.x

Scapy library

pip install scapy

Npcap (required for Windows packet capture)

Administrative privileges

Run as Administrator (Windows)

Run as root (Linux)

### ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DenizKaraman461/router.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🚦 Usage

1️⃣ Run Full Toolkit (Scan + MITM + Sniff)
python main.py -t <Target_IP> -g <Gateway_IP> --sniff

2️⃣ Network Discovery Only
python scanner.py

Lists all active devices on your local subnet.

3️⃣ Passive DNS Monitoring
python dns.py

Monitors DNS queries (requires appropriate network setup such as monitor mode or hub-based environment).
